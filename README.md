# hello-world
I, like many others, am learning GitHub - this had better be good!
My first edits to the read-me. This is already getting tedious...

About me:

I am an old curmudgeon IT professional who does web development now that I have retired.
I use HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, SQL as well as jQuery and Bootstrap. My CMS of choice is Joomla!
